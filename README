;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode for editing files used in Drela's aerodynamic
;; codes.  The mode supports syntax highlighting, easy tabbing through
;; and indentation of data elements, plotting of geometries, and running
;; AVL within EMACS.  This version is still a work-in-progress and only 
;; supports AVL and a little ASWING.  
;;
;; AVL functions:
;; C-p        Plots the geometry of the current AVL file
;; C-e        Executes AVL on the current AVL file
;; C-RET      Inserts a "standard" comment
;; C-Sh-RET   Removes the preceding comment
;; Tab        Moves to next element/indents elements
;; Sh-Tab     Moves to previous element
;;
;; ASWING functions:
;; Tab        Moves to next element/indents elements
;; Sh-Tab     Moves to previous element
